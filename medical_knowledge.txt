## Personalized Recommendations

*   **Elevated Blood Lipids:** It is recommended to adjust the diet, reduce the intake of high-cholesterol and high-fat foods, increase exercise, and take lipid-lowering drugs as directed by your doctor if necessary.
*   **Elevated Blood Glucose:** It is recommended to control your diet, avoid sugary foods, increase exercise, monitor blood glucose regularly, and take hypoglycemic drugs or inject insulin as directed by your doctor if necessary.
*   **Abnormal Liver Function:** It is recommended to avoid alcohol, pay attention to rest, avoid using drugs that are harmful to the liver, and have liver function rechecked regularly.
*   **Abnormal Kidney Function:** It is recommended to control your diet, avoid overwork, avoid using drugs that are harmful to the kidneys, and have kidney function rechecked regularly.
